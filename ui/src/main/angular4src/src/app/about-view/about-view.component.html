    Infosys DevOps Platform(IDP) is built on an extensible microservices architecture. It leverages the orchestration
    capabilities of the widely popular Jenkins and provides a layer of abstraction over it through Angular 5 based
    responsive web front end and Spring Boot based RESTful services.
